# Projects Using C++

A collection of C++ projects showcasing fundamental programming skills, object-oriented design, and problem solving.

---

## 🧰 Included Projects

- **Bank Account Management System**  
  Implements features like account creation, deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry. Demonstrates file handling and class-based organization in C++.

- **First_Project**  
  A small practice project to apply basic C++ syntax, loops, and conditional statements. Good for reinforcing foundations.

- **Secound_Project** *(sic)*  
  Another practice / experimental project. *(Rename “Secound” to “Second” for correctness.)*

## 🧪 Example Use Cases & Behavior

These are some example behaviors you should see / test in the **Bank Account Management System**:

* Creating a new account (e.g. enter account number, name).
* Deposit money into an account and display updated balance.
* Withdraw money (check for sufficient funds).
* Query account balance.
* Handling invalid inputs (e.g. wrong account number, negative amounts).

For the smaller practice projects, you might test loops, conditional branches, input/output prompts etc.

## 🔍 Design Choices & Challenges

* Use of **classes** to represent account(s) and encapsulate operations (deposit, withdraw, balance).
* Implementation of **file handling** so data persists between runs (if applicable).
* Dealing with user inputs: validating numeric inputs, rejecting invalid operations.
* Managing organization across different projects within the same repo.

## 💡 Potential Improvements

* Standardize naming (fix “Secound\_Project” → “Second\_Project”).
* Add **unit tests** for core functionality (e.g. deposit, withdraw).
* Build a menu-based user interface to allow selecting operations dynamically.
* Improve error handling (e.g. non-numeric, overflow, negative values).
* Add persistence across runs (save to file, load on startup).
* Refactor code to reduce duplication and improve modularity (header files, separate class files, namespaces).
